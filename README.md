Small web app to play the board game [Streams](http://www.moonstergames.com/streams/) in real life with real people.

All you need is 
- a device capable of dipslaying an HTML file (like a smartphone), 
- a bunch of pens
- to print some scoresheets (can be found for instance [here](http://www.jedisjeux.net/streams?game_id=5371&mode=goodies) - click on "Télécharger le goodies")
